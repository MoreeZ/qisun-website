I’m a book person. Books from different fields bring me inner peace. I started writing novels in fourth grade, inspired by the many fantasy and adventure stories I had read.
In middle school, I began reading classics. I followed literary awards like the Booker Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature. In high school, I was drawn to detective, horror, and suspense fiction.
At university, I started exploring knowledge from various fields. I read biographies of influential people in medicine, psychology, finance, and engineering. These books gave me constant inspiration for my writing.
People around me often say I’m emotionally steady. I believe reading plays a big role in that. I read around 150 books each year, which fills me with calm and focus. I also share my reading reflections on a Chinese social media platform, where I now have nearly 3,000 followers.
