I enjoy collecting wooden hairpins. Most of the ones I own are handmade, and the wood materials vary greatly. Among them, my favorites are ya bai(cliff cypress) and green sandalwood.

Ya bai is a rare and precious aromatic wood. It has a natural fragrance, unique grain, high density, and strong resistance to decay. It grows on steep cliffs and is considered a special variety of Chinese arborvitae. Mainly found in the Taihang Mountains, Qinling Mountains, and the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Chongqing, ya bai thrives in extremely harsh environments. It often takes hundreds or even thousands of years to mature, which makes it very rare.

Green sandalwood is a dense hardwood with colors ranging from green to yellow-green, which darken over time. It has a light, long-lasting fragrance, a fine texture, and a high oil content. It is not prone to cracking. Green sandalwood is commonly found in Central America, South America, and Southeast Asia, with South American green sandalwood being especially well known.

In addition to these, I've also collected hairpins made from other types of wood, such as ebony, cypress, pearwood, red sandalwood, and stabilized wood.
